abstract: In response to climate change, interventions have been implemented to encourage
  sustainable behavior. Such interventions may not only promote the target behavior but also
  increase (positive spillover) or reduce (negative spillover) non-targeted outcomes. This
  pre-registered meta-analysis integrated the experimental research on environmental
  spillover to update a previous meta-analysis (Maki et al., 2019). Database searches in
  several languages supplemented by searches to retrieve unpublished literature yielded 63
  aggregated effect sizes from 38 studies and 29 articles (N = 26,613 unique participants). 
  A three-level Bayesian meta-analysis provided weak support for a small positive spillover
  on intentions, δ = 0.15, 95% CrI [-0.01, 0.31], and strong support for no spillover on
  behaviors. Even if behavioral spillover was present, it would likely be negligible, δ =
  0.01, 95% CrI [-0.13, 0.16]. Positive spillover was most likely when interventions were
  autonomy-supportive (very strong evidence), provided a rationale (moderate to strong
  evidence), did not use financial (dis)incentives (weak to strong evidence), and addressed
  normative (extreme evidence) or a combination of normative and personal gain goals (strong
  evidence). Spillover was similar across research settings (moderate evidence) and partly
  samples (weak to moderate evidence), which tentatively suggests generalizability. To set
  standards for robust spillover research, we developed the Power-Reporting-Open science
  (PRO) guidelines. The Bayesian approach allows for robust conclusions and continuous
  updating with new evidence. We hope that this supports future revisions toward a
  sustainable overview of robust and high-powered spillover studies that independent
  researchers can easily update.
