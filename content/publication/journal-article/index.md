abstract: Pervading global narratives suggest that political polarization is increasing, yet
  the accuracy of such group meta-perceptions has been drawn into question. A recent US
  study suggests that these beliefs are inaccurate and drive polarized beliefs about
  out-groups. However, it also found that informing people of inaccuracies reduces those
  negative beliefs. In this work, we explore whether these results generalize to other
  countries. To achieve this, we replicate two of the original experiments with 10,207
  participants across 26 countries. We focus on local group divisions, which we refer to as
  fault lines. We find broad generalizability for both inaccurate meta-perceptions and
  reduced negative motive attribution through a simple disclosure intervention. We conclude
  that inaccurate and negative group meta-perceptions are exhibited in myriad contexts and
  that informing individuals of their misperceptions can yield positive benefits for
  intergroup relations. Such generalizability highlights a robust phenomenon with
  implications for political discourse worldwide.
