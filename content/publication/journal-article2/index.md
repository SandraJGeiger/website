abstract: In the absence of a vaccine, social distancing behaviour is pivotal to mitigate
  COVID-19 virus spread. In this large-scale behavioural experiment, we gathered data during
  Smart Distance Lab The Art Fair (n = 839) between August 28 and 30, 2020 in Amsterdam, the
  Netherlands. We varied walking directions (bidirectional, unidirectional, and no   
  directions) and supplementary interventions (face mask and buzzer to alert visitors of 1.5
  metres distance). We captured visitors’ movements using cameras, registered their contacts
  (defined as within 1.5 metres) using wearable sensors, and assessed their attitudes toward
  COVID-19 as well as their experience during the event using questionnaires. We also
  registered environmental measures (e.g., humidity). In this paper, we describe this
  unprecedented, multi-modal experimental data set on social distancing, including
  psychological, behavioural, and environmental measures. The data set is available on
  figshare and in a MySQL database. It can be used to gain insight into (attitudes toward)
  behavioural interventions promoting social distancing, to calibrate pedestrian models, and
  to inform new studies on behavioural interventions.
