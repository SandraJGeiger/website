I am a PhD student in the [Environmental Psychology Research Group](https://env-psy.univie.ac.at/about-us/) at the University of Vienna with Dr. Mathew White and Prof. Dr. Sabine Pahl. Before joining the University of Vienna, I completed a Research Master's in Social Psychology and Psychological Methods at the University of Amsterdam. My main research interests include social norms, second-order beliefs, behavior change, and spillover effects in the environmental domain. I am also interested in Bayesian statistics and hope to contribute to making (psychological) research more transparent, reproducible, and sustainable.

I am also affiliated with the [Junior Researcher Programme](https://jrp.pscholars.org) where I organized a summer school on "Sustainability: How Psychology can Contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals". I also oversee the research groups and help develop the scientific aspects of the program including implementing open science and organizing trainings for students.
