I am a PhD student in the Environmental Psychology Research Group with Mathew White and Sabine Pahl. Before joining the University of Vienna, I completed a research masterâ€™s in Social Psychology and Psychological Methods at the University of Amsterdam. My main interests include behavior change, spillover effects, decision-making, and risk communication in the environmental domain. I am also interested in Bayesian statistics and hope to contribute to making (psychological) research more transparent, reproducible, and sustainable. 

I am also affiliated with the Junior Researcher Programme (https://jrp.pscholars.org) where I help to develop the scientific aspects of the program, including implementing open science and organizing trainings for students.
