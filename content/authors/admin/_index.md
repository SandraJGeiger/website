I am a PhD researcher in the [Environmental Psychology Research Group](https://env-psy.univie.ac.at/about-us/) at the University of Vienna with Dr. Mathew White and Prof. Dr. Sabine Pahl.

My current line of research focuses on (mis)perceptions of social norms and how these (mis)perceptions can be leveraged to influence pro-environmental and conservation behavior. My research has been featured in several media outlets (ORF, Der Standard, and Austrian Press Agency) as well as on blogs and Wikipedia. I am also interested in Bayesian statistics and Big Team Science as well as hope to contribute to making (psychological) research more transparent, reproducible, and sustainable. 
. 

I am additionally affiliated with the [Junior Researcher Programme](https://jrp.pscholars.org) where I organized a summer school on *Sustainability: How Psychology can Contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals*. I also oversee the research groups and help develop the scientific aspects of the program including implementing open science and organizing trainings for students.
